For our project, we made an 8-bit Arduino synthesizer. This project gave us the chance to use our new knowledge of C as well as work on embedded programming skills with Arduino. The goal was to create a program that could take frequencies in the audible range, and play them on a speaker. In the end, we were only able to send a sine wave of one frequency to the Arduino to make sound, but we learned a lot from the experience.

Our hardware consists of an Arduino Mega(ATmega2560), an R-2R ladder network, an op-amp, a transistor, and a speaker. The ladder network is connected to 8 pins of the Mega, which allows us to pass 8 bits of resolution into the speaker. 

Our program generates a 256 element long array that contains sine wave values between 0 and 256. We then loop through each of these values and send them to the register on the Mega. When the values are passed through the ladder network, which outputs a voltage to the op-amp, which serves as a buffer. Then it is passed to the transistor which acts as an amplifier, and to the speaker which plays a sound based on how much voltage it is getting. 

When we finished this project, our biggest hurdle was getting the timing to work. The way that we had planned to loop through the values in the sine wave array was using hardware interrupts on the Mega. There is a built in timer on the board that runs at 16 mHz, and at certain times you can trigger functions. In our case, we wanted to use some conversions to set an interrupt that lined up with an input frequency, then we wanted to send a new value from the array each time the timer value was hit, and reset the timer. Unfortunately we were having a lot of trouble getting the interrupt to actually work, and Mega documentation was scarce. While debugging embedded code is a useful skill to practice, at the point that the project ended we did not think we would learn much more from continuing to work through it. One thing that could have work instead of the hardware interrupts was to find the frequency of the base loop, then calibrate it to other frequencies by using delays.
