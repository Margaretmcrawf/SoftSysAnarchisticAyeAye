## Arduino Synth Page
### http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/ArduinoSynth

A list of AVR synthesizer projects, with plenty of links to other resources.

## Direct Digital Synthesis Tutorial
### http://codeandlife.com/2012/03/13/fast-dds-with-atmega88/

A tutorial for generating sine waves via direct digital synthesis in software. Also dips into optimization with Assembly.

## AVRMIDI
### https://github.com/boourns/AVRMIDI

A library in C for dealing with the boilerplate of MIDI, if we choose to go in that direction. Deals with all the error handling and byte interpretation, and passes along MIDI events.

## 1-Bit AVR Synthesizer
### https://github.com/74hc595/1-Bit-AVR-Synthesizer/

SOmeone else doing almost the exact project we seem to want to do, with hardware and software implementation. Have not read through as to not color mind, but may be a useful resource.
